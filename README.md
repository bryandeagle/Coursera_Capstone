# Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone
This is a Github Repository for the [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).


## Structure
This repo hosts my final project. The structure is as follows:
- `data` has the static dataset(s) that were needed for this project. This consists of `austin.csv` which is a list of neighborhoods in Austin, Texas.
- `docs` is a static website resembling a *blog post* for the project, a required deliverable. It's based on the [Blog Bootstrap Example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/blog/).
- `jupyter` has the jupyter notebook `battle-of-the-neighborhoods.ipynb` which has all of the code and charts generated for the final deliverables of the project.
- `report` has a LaTeX report generated for this project, based on the results found in the jupyter notebook.
